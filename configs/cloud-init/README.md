# Cloud-init

This directory contains [cloud-init][docs-cloud-init] configuration files for the automated configuration of manually provisioned devices.

To provision a device, simply copy these appropriate files for the device to the boot partition of the desired system. For a pre-installed Ubuntu SD card image, such as the ones provided for the Raspberry Pi, simply copy theses files to the `system-boot` partition.
