# Infrastructure

A repository to automate the configuration of my local infrastructure.

My local infrastructure is my homelab, which I primarily use to learn about state-of-the-art technologies as well as to run applications for potential startup incubations.

As part of this repository you may find interesting learnings and insights that I came across when developing my homelab and its automation. Automating my infrastructure allows me to deploy workloads more efficiently and debug issues more quickly.

## History üìú

I have been running a homelab since 2014, where it started with a single [Cubietech Cubietruck][website-cubietruck]. It served as a NAS, LEMP server, and was a great introduction for me into Linux. Over time the setup grew to include other single board computers, such as the [Hardkernel Odroid XU4][website-odroidxu4].

Since 2018 I started to make significant changes by automating the configuration of my router and my manually provisioned servers via [Ansible][website-ansible]. Using it allowed me to learn the _classic way_ of Baremetal provisioning. It provided a solid tool to get me started with the deployment and operation of [Kubernetes][website-kubernetes] clusters.

Now, I am in the process of upgrading my infrastructure to become cloud-native and fully automated. The goal is to provide a RESTful API to provision baremetal machines from scratch, configure networking, and bootstrap and autoscale Kubernetes clusters.

## Networking üîå

Below, I describe the network setup of my Homelab. Some parts of it are already implemented, while others are still being conceptualized.

### DNS üåç

**Status:** üü¢ Operational

I register my domains with [Namecheap][website-namecheap], because they often provide good discounts on variety of domain names. Below, you may find a list of limitations that I ran into, which is the reason why I decided to only use them as a registrar, but not as a DNS provider.

- **Limited usability in CI**  
  Their API requires a manually administrated allow-list of trusted IPs. The allow list they offer does not allow CIDR notation IP ranges, e.g. `0.0.0.0/24`. The issue here is that [GitHub Actions'][website-github-actions] hosted runners do not have a static set of IPs. As I want to administrate my entire infrastructure via GitHub actions and pipelines, a self-host runner is not an option for me.

- **Slow API development**  
  The [Namecheap API][website-namecheap-api] is well-documented, but is not RESTful and uses XML. This setup is rather old-fashioned and makes it rather uncomfortable to use. Their customers have requested a more modern API surface, but so far the development of the API focuses on pure maintenance. Having a lightweight, easy-to-use API is critical when relying on it to build your products.

Therefore I decided to use [Google Cloud DNS][website-gcp-dns] for the automated administration of my DNS records. The deployment of my DNS infrastructure is automated using [GitHub Actions][website-github-actions] and [Pulumi][website-pulumi], because it allows me to write my _Infrastructure as Code_ using my favourite programming language [Go][website-go].

For more information you may want to check out the following files and directories:

- `main.go`: The entry point to my Pulumi program as a general overview.
- `pkg/dns/`: The configuration of DNSSEC and my DNS records.

### Routing üîÄ

**Status (v3):** üí° Planning

**Keywords:** BGP, Kubernetes Operator, [Kube-Router][website-kube-router], SDN  
**Motivation:** Automation, ease-of-operation, client source IPs

**Status (v2):** üü¢ Operational

This setup uses a [Seeed Dual Gigabit Ethernet NIC Carrier Board][shop-seeed-router] with a [Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4][shop-rpi-cm4] as a router. This setup allows it to run a Kubernetes cluster on my router and therefore on my network edge, which is not possible with my previous setup. This setup allows to build a custom orchestration layer for software defined networking via VLANs.

**Status (v1):** üî¥ End of life

In this setup I was running a [Ubiquity Edgerouter-X][website-erx] (ER-X) with port-forwarding towards a single baremetal [k3s cluster][website-k3s] on a seperate machine. The ER-X is fine, but not great for automation and dynamic configuration.

In this setup I was had two subnets, **userspace** (`192.168.0.1/24`) and **homelab** (`172.16.0.1/22`), where DHCP was only enabled in the **userspace** subnet. This setup allowed me to maintain network connectivity for **userspace** traffic while performing testing or configuration changes in my **homelab**. The configuration was hardcoded to specific ports on my router.

### VLANs üõ°Ô∏è

**Status:** üü¢ Operational

The table below describes the set of manually assigned VLANs. The configuration of the DHCPv4 server and my network interfaces via [netplan.io][docs-netplan] is based on the following resources:

- [Ubuntu community article about `isc-dhcp-server`][article-ubuntu-dhcp]
- [How to make a simple router on a Ubuntu server][medium-ubuntu-router]
- [`netplan.io` examples][docs-netplan-examples]

| VLAN ID | CIDR               | DHCP | Name       | Description                                                        |
| ------- | ------------------ | ---- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1       | `none`             | No   | default    | A network without any gateway to isolate unassigned hosts.         |
| 10      | `172.16.0.0/22`    | Yes  | management | A network for the configuration and management of network devices. |
| 4000    | `192.168.254.0/22` | No   | homelab    | A network for experimental deployments.                            |
| 4090    | `192.168.255.0/24` | Yes  | userspace  | A home network for WiFi and other domestic traffic.                |

### Firewall üî•

**Status (v1):** üü¢ Operational

I chose to use `nftables` as it provides a modern and declarative API. In the future the configuration should be managed via a software layer that performs automatic reconciliation.

For anyone replicating this setup, it might be worth noting that there was one major roadblock during the implementation, which took me a week to figure out. Make sure to configure MTU clamping as described in the reference below or shown in `configs/cloud-init/seeed-rtcm4-0/user-data`. The symptoms of this missing configuration option are that small TCP and UDP packets will be forwarded correctly, such as the `client hello` of a TLS handshake or DNS queries, but regular TCP traffic will just be dropped. This in turn causes websites to fail loading. If you are able to open [`https://api.ipify.org`][api-ipify] in your browser, but not [`https://wikipedia.org`][wikipedia] it may very well be related to this.

### Load balancing üîÅ

**Status:** üîµ Limited availability

Currently, I am only running [Traefik][website-traefik] as an [Ingress Controller][docs-ingress], which does load balancing and TLS termination for my pods in Kubernetes. In the future I would like to have automatic load balancing for my Kubernetes Control Planes and `LoadBalancer` type services.

**Status (v2):** üí° Planning

**Keywords:** BGP, [HAProxy][website-haproxy], [Gateway API][website-gateway-api]  
**Motivation:** Automation, ease-of-operation, client source IPs

## GitOps üîß

To automate deployments, I chose to implement GitOps via Argo CD. The initial installation procedure of Argo CD is described in [this blog post][website-argo-installation].

## Limitations‚ùó

Below you may find a list of limitations with my current infrastructure setup.

- **Manual NS and DS records**  
  Due to the limitations of the [Namecheap API][website-namecheap-api], I decided to completely administrate my NS and DS records by hand. If I can't automate it for one registrar, I will not automate it for any of them. This is subject to change based on the amount of domains and the frequency of changes. Usually however NS records rarely change.

- **Manual administration of VLANs**  
  Because my network contains a variety of network devices with different management protocols, there is a currently little value in automating the management of VLANs. If this should prove to be a valuable investment at some point, the links below include information on how to interface with some of my hardware via protocols such as the _Easy Smart Configuration Protocol (ESCP)_.
